the Rainmeter package manager. Install skins directly from the command line!

# Installation

Download the latest .rmskin from [releases](https://github.com/meters-on-demand/cli/releases).

MonD installs through Rainmeter so it can get the #SKINSPATH# and #SETTINGSPATH# variables, to detect which skins you have installed. And as MonD is a skin manager, it can update itself through itself.

# Usage

To use MonD, you need to use the command line. Both `cmd` and `powershell` work. You can try `mond version` to test that MonD installed correctly.

Notice that if you had your terminal open before running the installer, you need to reopen it to make Windows detect the MonD script.

```shell
install [-Skin] <full_name> [-Force]
# installs the specified skin

list
# lists installed skins

search [-Query] <keyword> [-Property <property>]
# searches the skin list

update [-Force]
# updates the skins list

upgrade [-Skin] <full_name> [-Force]
# upgrades the specified skin

uninstall [-Skin] <full_name> [-Force]
# uninstalls the specified skin

restore [-Skin] <full_name> [-Force]
# restores an upgraded or uninstalled skin from @Backup

init [-Skin] <skin_name>
# creates a new skin folder from a template

package [[-Skin] <rootconfig>] [...]
# Creates an .rmskin package of the specified skin.

version
# prints the MonD version

help [-Command]
# shows this help
```

# TO-DO:

- [ ] Implement fuzzy search :3
- [ ] Use Version from mond.inc for skins that have it
- [ ] Integrate death.crafters silent install script for silent installs and mass upgrades
- [ ] Use PSRM in Installer.ini to show status messages while installing (?)
- [ ] Packager skin that can
  - Take all of the information with the GUI
  - Read existing .rmskins by drag + drop
  - Create mond.inc and save the information
  - Read mond.inc and autofill the GUI
  - Package skins
- [x] Detect removed / privated repos and remove them from the API
- [ ] Detect included and used Fonts
  - Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore
  - (New-Object -TypeName Windows.Media.GlyphTypeface -ArgumentList 'path\to\font').Win32FamilyNames.Values
- [x] Make -Version a string and use it instead of -PackageVersion
  - Would have to do parsing in the .bat script before calling MetersOnDemand.ps1
  - Or just remove -Version as an alias for `mond version`
